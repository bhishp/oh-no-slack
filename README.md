Sometimes things just don't work out and all you can do is say... oh no.

This is a slack app, you can install it to your workspace with the button below:

### Big thanks

Of course to https://twitter.com/dorrismccomics for creating the blob

And to [@caseyf](https://github.com/caseyf) for doing all the hard work when creating [the webcomicname mashup app](https://glitch.com/~webcomicname-mashup)

### Feedback

Let me know what you think, raise PRs or issues.

All the noticiations are in_channel right now and the mashup takes up a lot of slack real-estate when it renders, probably this can be improved.
